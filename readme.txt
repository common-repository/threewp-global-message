WP / WPMU plugin to display different global messages in the admin panel according to user role. Like the "premium" plugin but better.

WP / WPMU plugin to display different global messages in the admin panel according to user role. Administrators, editors, authors, contributors and subscribers can all be configured to each receive their own message or even no message at all.
